<h1>How to play:</h1>
<p>Players: 2</p>
<p>Object of the Game - to defeat the other team.</p>
<p>Each player gets a team. There are two teams: Power Miners and Rock Monsters.
The Power Miners have more "soldiers", but the Rock Monsters are
stronger. The game is played in turns, and the Power Miners go first. </p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Power Miners</b> -- You can move each Power Miner once per turn. To
move, you click on the power miner you would like to move and click on the
playing field where you would like him to move. You can only move each player so
far. When each power miner is clicked on, his profile appears on the lower half
of the screen. This consists of his remaining lives, his picture, his name, and
his weapons. Remember, you move may move each power miner once per turn. To get
a crystal, click on the power miner you would like to move, and click on the
crystal. When Power Miners get the crystals, it just vanishes - they don't get
to use it. Crystals will continually pop up on the battle field - there are
always three crystals somewhere. To attack a Rock Monster, first hover your
mouse over him. A small grayish square will appear in front of him. Next, click
the Power Miner you would like to move and click on that square. When the Power
Miner has moved all the way over, a message will appear, saying who is fighting
who. This is a sign that a fight is in progress. When a fight is going on, you
won't be able to do anything else, such as move another player, until you finish
the fight. If you try, a message will pop up, telling you that a fight is going
on. To do the fight, click on a weapon in the lower right hand corner. Make sure
you are clicked on the power miner who is fighting - otherwise you won't be able
to choose a weapon. After you choose a weapon, click the "Strike"
button below the weapon. A message will appear, telling you who was hit, by how
much his life value went down, and what his life value is now.&nbsp; For
example, it may say, "Glaciator's life has gone down by 4. Now his life
value is 36."&nbsp; If the Rock Monster you attacked has lost all his
lives, he will disappear, and a message will tell you he is dead. You win by
killing all the Rock Monsters.&nbsp; </p>
<p> When you have finished your turn, click the button that says "Player
2's turn..." or "Player 1's turn..." After you do this, it is
the next player's turn. Hand over the mouse and let&nbsp;him move. </p>
<p><b>Rock Monsters </b>-- The Rock Monsters move in exactly the same way as the
Power Miners (once per turn, click where you want them to move, etc.) However,
crystals are different. You still click on the crystal to get it, but once you
have gotten it, it will disappear <i>and</i> the Rock Monster will gain another
weapon. That weapon is the "Crystal-Zap Power." You can only use this
weapon twice, but don't worry, there are plenty of crystals hanging around for
you to grab. Fighting is the same as with the Power Miners. You win by killing
all the Power Miners. </p>
<p><STRONG>Tips</STRONG>--</p>
<P><EM>Power Miners</EM> -- Try to get the crystals before the Rock Monsters do 
- the crystal-zap power is their greatest weapon. Also, when fighting Rock 
Monsters, try to separate them and gang up. For Example, pull Glaciator apart 
from Boulderax and make Rex and Jed attack Glaciator. Remember, you have more 
players, so it's easy to gang up. This is probably your best chance.</P>
<P><EM>Rock Monsters --</EM> Your power is in strength. Stick together but try 
to pull the Power Miners apart so that they can't gang up on you. Most likely 
they will send miners to get the crystals instead of fighting you - seize your 
chance. If you can, gang up to quickly eliminate a power miner and thus even the 
amount of fighters on each team. Try to get the crystals but stay near the 
fighting. </P>
